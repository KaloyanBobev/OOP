﻿/*Define abstract class Shape with only one abstract method CalculateSurface() and fields width and height.
 * Define two new classes Triangle and Rectangle that implement the virtual method and return the surface of
 * the figure (height*width for rectangle and height*width/2 for triangle). Define class Circle and suitable
 * constructor so that at initialization height must be kept equal to width and implement the CalculateSurface() method.
 * Write a program that tests the behavior of  the CalculateSurface() method for different shapes (Circle, Rectangle, Triangle) stored in an array.*/
